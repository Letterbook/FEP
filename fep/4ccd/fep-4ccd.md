# FEP-4ccd: Pending Followers Collection and Pending Following Collection

## Summary

This specification defines two collections, `pendingFollowers` and `pendingFollowing`, with which users can review and manage their pending follow requests.

## Motivation

[ActivityPub] represents a directed social graph with `followers` and `following` properties on actors. To initiate a relationship, a `Follow` activity is sent from the potential follower to the followed actor, who can `Accept` or `Reject` it.

Between the time that a `Follow` is sent and the time that it is accepted or rejected, the relationship is in a pending state. This is not represented in the ActivityPub data model.

The new `pendingFollowers` collection can be used to review incoming `Follow` activities to `Accept` or `Reject` them.

The new `pendingFollowing` collection can be used to review outgoing `Follow` activities to `Undo` them.

Because the full activity data is needed to `Accept`, `Reject` or `Undo`, these collections should include `Follow` activities, and not just the actors requesting to follow.

## Details

`pendingFollowers` is a property of an actor. It is a collection of `Follow` activities that have been sent **to** the actor, but not yet been accepted or rejected.

`pendingFollowing` is a property of an actor. It is a collection of `Follow` activities that have been sent **by** the actor, but not yet been accepted or rejected.

Both properties MUST be an `OrderedCollection` or `Collection`. Items in the collection MUST be in reverse chronological order.

Items in the collections MUST be `Follow` activities. They MUST be unique by `id`.

Each `object` of a `Follow` activity in the `pendingFollowing` collection MUST be unique by `id`.

Each `actor` of a `Follow` activity in the `pendingFollowers` collection MUST be unique by `id`.

When an `Accept`, `Reject`, or `Undo` activity with a `Follow` activity as `object` is processed, that `Follow` activity MUST NOT be included in the `pendingFollowers` and `pendingFollowing` collections in the future.

## Context

The context document for this specification is `https://purl.archive.org/socialweb/pending`. Its contents are as follows:

```
{
  "@context": {
    "pdg": "https://purl.archive.org/socialweb/pending#",
    "pendingFollowers": {
      "@id": "pdg:pendingFollowers",
      "@type": "@id"
    },
    "pendingFollowing": {
      "@id": "pdg:pendingFollowing",
      "@type": "@id"
    }
  }
}
```

## Examples

A publisher can include the `pendingFollowers` and `pendingFollowing` collection in the properties of an actor.

```
{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
        "https://purl.archive.org/socialweb/pending"
    ],
    "id": "https://example.com/evanp",
    "type": "Person",
    "name": "Evan Prodromou",
    "inbox": "https://example.com/evanp/inbox",
    "outbox": "https://example.com/evanp/outbox",
    "following": "https://example.com/evanp/following",
    "followers": "https://example.com/evanp/followers",
    "liked": "https://example.com/evanp/liked",
    "pendingFollowers": "https://example.com/evanp/pendingFollowers",
    "pendingFollowing": "https://example.com/evanp/pendingFollowing"
}
```

Retrieving the `pendingFollowers` collection would show incoming follow requests
for this actor.

```
{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
        "https://purl.archive.org/socialweb/pending"
    ],
    "id": "https://example.com/evanp/pendingFollowers",
    "type": "OrderedCollection",
    "name": "Pending followers for Evan Prodromou",
    "orderedItems": [
        {
            "type": "Follow",
            "id": "https://example.net/alyssa/follow/7",
            "summary": "Alyssa wants to follow Evan",
            "content": "Hey, Evan! It's Alyssa from the conference.",
            "actor": {
                "id": "https://example.net/alyssa",
                "type": "Person",
                "name": "Alyssa P. Hacker"
            },
            "published": "2023-06-21T12:00:00Z"
        },
        {
            "type": ["http://custom.example/ns/Archive", "Follow"],
            "id": "https://social.example/jokebot3000/follow/287",
            "summary": "Jokebot 3000 wants to follow Evan to archive his jokes",
            "actor": {
                "id": "https://social.example/jokebot3000",
                "type": "Application",
                "name": "Jokebot 3000"
            },
            "published": "2023-05-07T12:00:00Z"
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that the second, earlier `Follow` activity has a custom `type` property. Note also that the `object` of the `Follow` activities, which will be the same for every activity, is elided for clarity and space.

```
{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
        "https://purl.archive.org/socialweb/pending",
        {"sports": "https://sports.example/ns#"}
    ],
    "id": "https://example.com/evanp/pendingFollowing",
    "type": "Collection",
    "name": "Pending following for Evan Prodromou",
    "items": [
        {
            "type": ["sports:Fan", "Follow"],
            "id": "https://example.com/evanp/fan/309",
            "summary": "Evan is a fan of Jimena",
            "object": {
                "id": "https://tennis.example/jimena",
                "type": "Person",
                "name": "Jimena Suarez"
            },
            "published": "2023-04-19T12:00:00Z"
        },
        {
            "type": "Follow",
            "id": "https://example.net/evanp/follow/214",
            "summary": "Evan wants to follow Montreal Weather Updates",
            "object": {
                "id": "https://weather.example/canada/quebec/montreal",
                "type": "Service",
                "name": "Montreal Weather Updates"
            },
            "published": "2023-02-11T12:00:00Z"
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that the first `Follow` activity has a custom `type` property. Note also that the `actor` of the `Follow` activities, which will be the same for every activity, is elided for clarity and space. Finally, note that even though the collection's type is `Collection` and the items property is `items`, the activities still must be in reverse chronological order.

## Security considerations

The `pendingFollowers` and `pendingFollowing` collections are sensitive information about
an actor's social connections. For privacy, some services and actors do not share the `following` or `followers` collections. If not similarly protected, the `pendingFollowers` and `pendingFollowing` collections could be used to infer information about the actor's social connections before they are established.

Some services or actors do not forward `Reject` activities to the actor of a `Follow` activity. Harassing or abusive actors may try to determine if the actor has rejected their follow request by fetching the `pendingFollowers` collection.

For these reasons, publishers SHOULD NOT make the `pendingFollowers` and `pendingFollowing` collections visible to unauthenticated users. Publishers SHOULD NOT make the `pendingFollowers` and `pendingFollowing` collections visible to authenticated users who are not the actor.
