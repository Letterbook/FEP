# FEP-a070: Ordered properties for plain JSON consumers

## Summary

In a [Github-issue] filed against the normative AS2 context, it was pointed out that `attachment` and `tag` are unordered by default, although some implementations of "fediverse" software blindly assume them to always be ordered. This can be made unambiguous by using `@list` in JSON-LD, but for plain JSON consumers, a separate shorthand term must be defined. This FEP attempts to disambiguate between unordered and ordered arrays for those plain JSON consumers.

## Prior art in `items` vs `orderedItems`

(This section is non-normative.)

In the [AS2-vocab], there is `items`, which is used to express the items included in a Collection or OrderedCollection. However, in [ActivityPub], the OrderedCollection type is mandated to be reverse chronological order. Tangentially, it is valid to have a Collection with `items` that are either ordered or unordered.

The normative [AS2-context] deals with issue by defining two different terms: `items` and `orderedItems`. Both of these terms have the same `@id` of `https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#items` and the same `@type` of `@id` to indicate that they contain nodes on the graph, but `orderedItems` is additionally defined with a `@container` of an ordered `@list`, overriding the default `@container` of an unordered `@set`.

The use of `orderedItems` is present in the examples for `items` within [AS2-vocab], but it is not defined separately because it is not a separate term. Following this pattern, we can define similarly "ordered" counterparts to "unordered" existing properties.

## An exploration of properties that producers may wish to explicitly order

(This section is non-normative)

attachment
: There is nothing that requires attachments to an object to be ordered; however, it is a popular expectation in several cases that the attachments should be ordered. For example, someone authoring an object may wish to attach three images in order, representing a triptych. If the array order of `attachment` were to be changed, this would change the author's intended representation.

tag
: Tags are generally freeform and not meant to be parsed in any order, but some use-cases may wish to order tags as well. For example, Tumblr allows users to set the order their tags are presented in, and users sometimes use these tags to communicate a series of comments or thoughts without having them be present in the conversational context.

name
: A thing may have multiple names, some of which are preferred more than others. Having an array for `name` is likely to confuse existing implementations at the time of writing this FEP, but it is something that could conceivably be useful for several use-cases.

oneOf/anyOf
: When a Question represents a poll with predefined options for possible answers, the order of the options may be relevant to understanding the poll. Consider a self-referential poll that asks you to predict which option will receive the most votes: "option 2", "option 3", or "option 1".

## Terms defined by this FEP

In the associated [context](./context.jsonld), we define the following terms:

### orderedAttachment

URI
: `https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#attachment`

Notes
: https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-attachment

JSON-LD definition:

```json
{
	"@context": {
		"orderedAttachment": {
			"@id": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#attachment",
			"@type": "@id",
			"@container": "@list"
		}
	}
}
```

### orderedTag

Term
: `orderedTag`

URI
: `https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#tag`

Notes
: https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-tag

JSON-LD definition:

```json
{
	"@context": {
		"orderedTag": {
			"@id": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#tag",
			"@type": "@id",
			"@container": "@list"
		}
	}
}
```
