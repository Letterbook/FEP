# FEP-8c3f: Web Monetization


## Summary

Web Monetization federation via [ActivityPub].


## History

The ability to transfer money has been a long-standing omission from the web platform. As a result, the web suffers from a flood of advertising and corrupt business models. Web Monetization provides an open, native, efficient, and automatic way to compensate creators, pay for API calls, and support crucial web infrastructure.

[Web Monetization] is being proposed as a W3C standard at [the Web Platform Incubator Community Group](https://discourse.wicg.io/t/proposal-web-monetization-a-new-revenue-model-for-the-web/3785).


## Requirements

In GNU social this is [implemented on a plugin](https://code.undefinedhackers.net/GNUsocial/gnu-social/src/branch/v3/plugins/WebMonetization/WebMonetization.php#L243) using an extra property `gs:webmonetizationWallet` on the actor object.


### Example

```json
{
  "type": "Person",
  "streams": [],
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    {
      "gs": "https://www.gnu.org/software/social/ns#"
    },
    {
      "webmonetizationWallet": {
        "@id": "gs:webmonetizationWallet",
        "@type": "@id"
      }
    }
  ],
  "id": "https://social.gnusocial.rocks/actor/42",
  "inbox": "https://social.gnusocial.rocks/actor/42/inbox.json",
  "outbox": "https://social.gnusocial.rocks/actor/42/outbox.json",
  "following": "https://instance.gnusocial.test/actor/42/subscriptions",
  "followers": "https://instance.gnusocial.test/actor/42/subscribers",
  "preferredUsername": "alice",
  "name": "Alyssa P.Hacker",
  "url": "https://social.gnusocial.rocks/@alice",
  "webmonetizationWallet": "$wallet.example.com/alice"
}
```

## About the value of `gs:webmonetizationWallet`

That string is the same as the example one in [Web Monetization specification](https://webmonetization.org/specification.html#web-monetization-meta-tag)
and it consists on a [payment pointer](https://paymentpointers.org/#syntax/).

> Payment Pointers start with a `$` character to distinguish them from other identifiers and make it obvious that they are related to payments. To convert a Payment Pointer to a URL the $ is replaced with the standard prefix of a secure URL, `https://`.
