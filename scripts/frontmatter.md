# Fediverse Enhancement Proposals

<!-- DO NOT EDIT! File automatically generated with scripts/create_readme.py. -->

This is the Git repository containing Fediverse Enhancment Proposals (FEPs).

A Fediverse Enhancement Proposal (FEP) is a document that provides information to the Fediverse community. The goal of a FEP is to improve interoperability and well-being of diverse services, applications and communities that form the Fediverse.

The FEP Process is an initiative of the [SocialHub](https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks) developer community, a liaison of the [W3C Social Web Incubator Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/SocialCG/). For ongoing and past discussion see the [SocialHub FEP category](https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/c/standards/fep/54).
